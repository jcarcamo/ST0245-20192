# ST0245 Workshop 2
### Recursion


####Preparation:  
Attended class on recursion.

####Objectives (after completing the lab you will be able to do:)
* Learn to write recursive programs
* Create back-trace graphs for your recursive program
* Use the Java IntelliJ Debugger to help with your program.

This lab is important because of the following:
1.	The projects do not have (minimal) recursion as part of their requirements
2.	There are recursive problems on the mid-terms. 

So, lets practice. ðŸ˜Š


Activities:
1.	Open a web browser and go to: [http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1)

2.	Pick the following three recursive problems and solve each one:
* [Factorial](https://codingbat.com/prob/p154669)
* [CountX](https://codingbat.com/prob/p170371)
* [EndX](https://codingbat.com/prob/p105722)

3.	Pick 5 different recursive problems that you want to do and solve each one

4.	Get check off by the instructor
