# ST0245 Workshop 5
### Stacks

#### Preparation:  
Attended class on stacks.

#### Objectives (after completing the workshop you will be able to do:)
* Use stacks in your algorithms

#### Activities:
1. Reverse a String
Given a String like "Stacks are easy" create a program that outputs: "ysae era skcatS".
Now create the same program by using Stacks.

2. Check if a String is a palindrome
A palindrome is a word that is read equally from left to right and from right to left, for example: "madam" or "was it a car or a cat I saw".
Create an algorithm that tells if a given String is a palindrome or it isn't. 
Now try to do it using Stacks.

3. Check if an expression has balanced groups
Given a String expression, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of "{}", "[]", "()" are correct in the expression. For example "[()]{}{[()()]()}" should return true, while "[(])" should return false.
